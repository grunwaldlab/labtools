# Labtools

Labtools is a R package currently under development to aid in the creation and maintenance of research notebooks.
Currently, the primary focuses are:

* Functions to create a standardized rmarkdown notebook template that can be "built" into a website simply by following a specified folder structure and naming convention (inspired by [Noble 2009](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424#pcbi-1000424-g001)).
* Functions to create rmarkdown "recipes" for typical molecular biology laboratory techniques (e.g. PCR and dilutions). 
* Functions to parse the file formats returned by laboratory equipment (e.g. nanodrop and qubit, etc)
