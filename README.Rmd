# Labtools

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/grunwaldlab/labtools.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/grunwaldlab/labtools?branch=master)

Labtools is a R package to aid in the creation and maintenance of research notebooks.

**This package is mostly for in-lab own use, but could develop into something more official if others want to use it or contribute. It is not well supported or tested (yet).
Contributions are welcome!**

## Installation

Labtools is an R package available on GitHub, so it can be installed from the RStudio console or an R command line session using the `devtools` command `install_github`.
First, make sure `devtools` is installed:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

Next, install the package from GitHub by entering:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("grunwaldlab/labtools")
```

The package should now be installed and can be loaded using:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(labtools)
```

## Documentation

It does not exist for the package as a whole; sorry.
If you plan on using the package and want documentation, let me know by starting an issue. 
Each function has at least some documentation that can be accessed by typing `?funtion_name` at the R console.
