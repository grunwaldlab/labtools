Labtools is a R package currently under development to aid in the creation and maintenance of research notebooks.
Currently, there are two primary focuses:

* Functions to create a standardized rmarkdown notebook template that can be "built" into a website simply by following a specified folder structure and naming convention (inspired by @noble2009quick).
* Functions to create rmarkdown "recipes" for typical molecular biology laboratory techniques (e.g. PCR and dilutions). 
* Functions to parse the file formats returned by laboratory equipment (e.g. nanodrop and qubit, etc)
