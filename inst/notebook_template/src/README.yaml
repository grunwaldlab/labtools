########## Readme for the 'src' directory ##########################################################
# This directory should contain any custom scripts or source code used in the analysis of notes 
# in the 'results' directory or during compilation of notes.
# More standardized binary programs should be put in the 'bin' directory, not here. 
#
# Ideally, each file in this folder should have a description in the list below, in the format:
# "file_name.ext: A description of this file"
# This readme uses the YAML format.
# Look up the YAML syntax to resolve questions on proper format.
